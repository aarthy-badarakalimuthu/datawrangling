,"Note: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate negative values. For years 1990 to 2004, the Inventory methodology uses the first order decay methodology. A methodological change occurs in year 2005. For years 2005 to 2017, directly reported net CH4 emissions from the GHGRP data plus a scale-up factor are used to account for emissions from landfill facilities that are not subject to the GHGRP. These data incorporate CH4 recovered and oxidized. As such, CH4 generation and CH4 recovery are not calculated separately. See the Time-Series Consistency section of this chapter for more information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
