,"a These emissions have already been included in the estimates of net annual changes in C stocks, which include the amount sequestered minus any emissions, including the assumption that combusted wood may continue to decay through time.",,,,
,"b The data for 2017 were unavailable when these estimates were summarized; therefore 2016, the most recent available estimate, is applied to 2017. ",,,,
