"a These estimates include carbon stock changes from drained organic soils from both Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land. See the section below on CO2, CH4, and N2O Emissions from Drained Organic Soils for the methodology used to estimate the C flux from drained organic soils.  Also, see Table 6?22 and Table 6?23 for greenhouse gas emissions from non-CO2 gases changes from drainage of organic soils from Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land.",,,,
