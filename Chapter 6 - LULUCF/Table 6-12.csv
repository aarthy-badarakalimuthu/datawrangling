,"Notes: Forest area and C stock estimates include all Forest Land Remaining Forest Land in the conterminous 48 states and Alaska (million ha). Forest C stocks do not include forest stocks in U.S. Territories, Hawaii, or trees on non-forest land (e.g., agroforestry systems and settlement areas—see Section 6.10 Settlements Remaining Settlements for estimates of C stock change from settlement trees). The forest area estimates in this table do not match those in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base, which includes all managed forest land in Hawaii. Differences also exist because forest land area estimates are based on the latest NFI data through 2017 and woodland area previously included as forest land has been separated and included in the Grassland categories in this Inventory. Forest ecosystem C stocks on managed forest land in Alaska were compiled using the gain-loss method as described in Annex 3.13. Harvested wood product stocks include exports, even if the logs are processed in other countries, and exclude imports. Harvested wood estimates are based on results from annual surveys and models. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Population estimates compiled using FIA data are assumed to represent stocks as of January 1 of the Inventory year. Flux is the net annual change in stock. Thus, an estimate of flux for 2017 requires estimates of C stocks for 2017 and 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
