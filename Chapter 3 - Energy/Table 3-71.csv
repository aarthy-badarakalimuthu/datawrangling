,a Range of emission estimates estimated by applying the 95 percent confidence intervals obtained from the Monte Carlo Simulation analysis conducted for the year 2017 CH4 emissions.,,,,,,
,"b All reported values are rounded after calculation. As a result, lower and upper bounds may not be duplicable from other rounded values as shown in Table 3-64 and Table 3-65.",,,,,,
,c An uncertainty analysis for the CO2 emissions was not performed. The relative uncertainty estimated (expressed as a percent) from the CH4 uncertainty analysis was applied to the point estimate of CO2 emissions. ,,,,,,
